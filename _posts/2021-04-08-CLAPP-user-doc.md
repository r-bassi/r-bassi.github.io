CLAPP is a customer loyalty program designed for small businesses. There are many kinds of software out there that have options for customer loyalty data storage, however most of those applications are subscription based or require upfront purchases. CLAPP is a customer data management program that is lightweight and open source, allowing it to run on low-spec Windows based POS systems. Since it is open source, experienced developers also have the ability to make changes to the code to fit the exact specifications of the users requirements.
