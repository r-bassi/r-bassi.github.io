# About Me

Hi, my name is Rohit, this is my personal website! I'm an experienced professional with a strong background in data analysis and programming. Proficient in languages such as Python, Java, and SQL (among others). I have developed internal programs, managed data for machine learning models, and created informative dashboards. I have also gained experience in web development, working on a full-stack itinerary planning application. With excellent organizational and communication skills, I have previously served as a Data Analyst at FORM and a teaching assistant at UBC's Math Department. I am graduating this year with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia.

Feel free to browse around, check out my projects, or get in contact with me by Email or LinkedIn.
